## Hi there, I'm Connor! 👋

Check out some of my favorite technical projects and experiences below!

- ☔ I helped develop the [Probabilistic Precipitation Portal](https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/Prob_Precip/) for the National Weather Service in my first full-time role
- 🌊 I spent summer 2022 writing Python for the National Weather Service<br/>_(I helped develop a nationwide replacement for a portion of RiverPro, an older portion of [AWIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Weather_Interactive_Processing_System))_
- ⛈️ I spent summer 2021 at [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu/)/[Unidata](https://github.com/Unidata) contributing to [MetPy](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy)<br/>_(My largest contribution was the [`PlotGeometry`](https://gist.github.com/23ccozad/8c5ee73731c466be2ed00817aabd792d) class, which allows users to plot GeoJSON/Shapefile data on maps in MetPy)_
- 🏈 I helped create a [machine learning model](https://github.com/23ccozad/nfl-4th-down-ml-model) that chooses the optimal 4th down play for NFL teams
- 🌀 I created a [neural network](https://github.com/23ccozad/hurricane-wind-speed-cnn) that estimates a hurricane's wind speed based on its satellite image
- 🦠 I made a [COVID-19 dashboard](https://github.com/23ccozad/covid19-edutrack-cofc) used at the College of Charleston

I also keep a list of all of my [contributions to open source](https://github.com/23ccozad/23ccozad/blob/main/contributions.md).
