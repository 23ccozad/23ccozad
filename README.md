### Hi there, I'm Connor! 👋

I'm a rising senior studying Data Science at the College of Charleston.

Check out some of my favorite projects and experiences below!

- 🌊 I am spending summer 2022 writing Python for [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/)/[National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/)
- ⛈️ I spent summer 2021 at [UCAR](https://www.ucar.edu/)/[Unidata](https://github.com/Unidata) contributing to [MetPy](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy) (I'm most proud of creating the [`PlotGeometry`](https://gist.github.com/23ccozad/8c5ee73731c466be2ed00817aabd792d) class, which enables plotting GeoJSON/Shapefile data on maps in MetPy)
- 🏈 I helped create a [machine learning model](https://github.com/23ccozad/nfl-4th-down-ml-model) that chooses the optimal 4th down play for NFL teams
- 🌀 I created a [neural network](https://github.com/23ccozad/hurricane-wind-speed-cnn) that estimates a hurricane's wind speed based on it's satellite image
- 🦠 I made a [COVID-19 dashboard](https://github.com/23ccozad/covid19-edutrack-cofc) used by the College of Charleston
